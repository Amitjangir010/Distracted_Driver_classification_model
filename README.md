# Distracted Driver MultiAction Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify images of drivers into 10 distinct classes based on their activities, enhancing road safety by identifying distracted driving behaviors.

## Data Description
The dataset comprises images categorized into 10 classes, reflecting different driver activities:

- c0: Safe driving
- c1: Texting - right
- c2: Talking on the phone - right
- c3: Texting - left
- c4: Talking on the phone - left
- c5: Operating the radio
